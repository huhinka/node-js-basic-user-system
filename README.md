# Node JS Basic User System

Project inspired by [node js project ideas for beginners][1].

>Another application that you can do for training is a Basic User System. It’s a basic project, but it will help you to practice very useful skills because the user is a part of almost every application. 
>
>In this example, you will learn:  
>- how to set up the database and do migrations,  
>- how to create a new user by the registration,  
>- how to build login endpoint,  
>- how to authenticate user,  
>- how to get the user’s data.
>
>In the case of registration and login, you should generate a JWT token for the user that will be returned from the API.
>
>Besides that, remember to hash the password before you save it in the database.
>
>If you’d like to look at how I was doing user registration, login, and authentication in our NodeJS Course.
